    Introduction to Tulip !
</h1>
<p>Welcome to the world of Tulip!<br>Tulips are erect flowers with long, broad, parallel-veined leaves and a cup-shaped, single or double flower at the tip of the stem. 
    <br><br>Why?<br><b>Colors of the flowers can range anywhere from red to yellow to white.</b>Some tulips are varicolored as a result of a viral disease carried and transferred to the plants by aphids.<br><br>
    Tulips promote regeneration and can be used for the repair and growth of tissues throughout the body and are required for the production of collagen.
